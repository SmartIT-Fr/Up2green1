   * Verifies that the customer is allowed to make the purchase. The approve 
   * action helps to ensure that a customer has adequate funds available to make 
   * the purchase. Depending on the payment type and business policy, varying 
   * actions will be performed. For example, in the case of credit cards, a credit
   * card authorization request is sent and a transaction is approved, thereby 
   * ensuring the merchant will receive payment. A positive approval results in an 
   * authorization code being generated, and those funds being set aside. The 
   * cardholder's credit limit is then reduced by the authorized or approved amount.
   * The intention is that payment problems that are detected can be communicated 
   * back to the customer while the customer is online. The approve action does not 
   * apply to all payment methods. For instance, it would not make sense for an 
   * approve action to occur for electronic check (ACH) transactions.
