/**
 * This interface can be implemented by tables whose records are listen to 
 * payment events.
 *  
 * You only need to implement this interface if you want to alter the 
 * loading process for event handlers. By default, only the handling record
 * itself is fetched from the database. But you also might want to fetch
 * certain relations which are mandatory for processing events. In this case,
 * you can implement this interface to avoid all relations from being lazy
 * loaded which can result in a huge number of queries.
